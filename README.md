# Tucson Pathways - Website & Web-Map
The goal of this project is two fold:
### (1) education and outreach via website
by illustrating a safer way to perceive our city in terms of bicycle commuting. For non-bicycle commuters who are interested in riding more but apprehensive due to safety concerns, bicycle lanes can be extremely intimidating. 

### (2) provide bicycle navigation via web-map
for bicycle commuters who need navigation on the fly.
